# VirtualPet
My virtual creature was inspired by a toy as well as a pet aquarium called 
"Sea Monkeys Ocean Zoo." The animals in this aquarium called "sea monkeys", inspired 
the appearance and functionality of my virtual creatures. Additionally, I coded the 
creatures as if they are your virtual pet, where you have to take care of them in the 
most simple way!

The size of the display window is 400x400 to better reflect the real aquarium since it 
is also small due to sea monkeys being pretty small. I also designed the background as 
if it is that aquarium, where I also coded the creatures to bump to the sides, giving 
the idea of a closed enclosure.

To talk about the creatures, they are designed to reflect the appearance of a sea monkey.
They move around the "aquarium" randomly, bumping to the sides; they reproduce every 7 
seconds and need attention every 10 seconds. When they need attention, they stop moving 
where a text appears to remind you of that. By clicking on the screen, you can resolve 
this issue!

P.S. I kept the span of their need for attention and reproduction as brief as possible 
to present their functions faster.
